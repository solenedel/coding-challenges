# Robot in a square grid

## Layout of the problem and solution

Of course, the robot doesn't have any knowledge of the size of the grid (9x9 squares), otherwise it would be able to calculate the number of rooms in one step. The robot must visit each room in order to count the total number of rooms in the grid. However, it does not need to open all closed doors. 

Even though the robot itself has no knowledge of the size of the grid, the program that simulates this game should be able to generate the 9x9 grid, along with which walls have open doors, closed doors, and which have no doors. This way, the robot can check the walls against the grid generated by the program, even if the values corresponding to the number of rows and columns of the grid cannot be used by the robot itself.

The general steps to implement this problem would be:

## Step 1: Generate a grid to be used by the program

## Step 2: Define a function for the robot to check and count
