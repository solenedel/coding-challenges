# Robot in a square grid

## Layout of the problem and solution

Of course, the robot doesn't have any knowledge of the size of the grid (9x9 squares), otherwise it would be able to calculate the number of rooms in one step. The robot must visit each room in order to count the total number of rooms in the grid. However, it does not need to open all closed doors. 

Even though the robot itself has no knowledge of the size of the grid, the program that simulates this game should be able to generate the 9x9 grid, along with which walls have open doors, closed doors, and which have no doors. This way, the robot can check the walls against the grid generated by the program, even if the values corresponding to the number of rows and columns of the grid cannot be used by the robot itself.

The general steps to implement this problem would be:

## Step 1: Generate the grid

The grid can be represented as an array of length 81 (9x9). Each element of the array is an object which represents a single room. 

An example of what one element would look like:
```
{
  coordinates: [1, 1], 
  visited: true,
  walls: ['closed', 'closed', 'none', 'none']
}
```
This object represents the room the robot starts in: the lower right corner of the grid. The visited property is a boolean, true if the robot has visited the room and false otherwise.


## Step 2: Define a function for the robot to check and count
