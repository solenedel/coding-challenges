# Robot in a square grid

## Assumptions

1. The robot must visit each room in order to count the total number of rooms (ie. the robot cannot use length * width of the grid in order to calculate the number of rooms).

2. The robot has access to its starting coordinates. When it starts at the bottom right corner, this is room [1, 1]. If the robot starts in a random room of the grid, for example the room at [3, 5] - it is aware of these coordinates but has no further information about the total size of the grid. 


## Generating the grid

Even though the robot itself has no knowledge of the size of the grid, the program that simulates this game should be able to generate the 9x9 grid, along with which walls have open doors, closed doors, and which have no doors. This way, the robot can check the walls of the grid generated by the program, even if the values corresponding to the total number of rows and columns of the grid cannot be used by the robot itself.
